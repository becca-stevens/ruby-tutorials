1. Create a Hash that maps each letter to its index in the alphabet
    { a: 0, b: 1, ... }
    { 'a' => 0, ... }






2. Create a function that takes an array of words ['apple', 'banana', 'carrot'] and returns one of these:
    A) a hash that maps words to word lengths -- { apple: 5, banana: 6, ... }
    B) a hash that maps word lengths to an array of words whose length is that -- { 5: ['apple'], 6: ['banana', 'carrot'] }








3. Given a file with whatever text, create a hash representing the number of times each word appears.
    Once you have that working, print the words and their counts in descending order (highest count first)
    You can use `walrus-and-carpenter.txt` to test your script (`walrus-and-carpenter-counts.txt` will tell you
    if your solution is close to mine).
