1. FizzBuzz

Write a script called 'fizzbuzz.rb' that prints all numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
BUT:
- if the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'.
- if the number is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'.
- if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.





2. FizzBuzz with customizable range (bit harder)

Write a function that fizzbuzzes from any start integer to any end integer
- there are multiple ways to provide the start/end numbers and they're all good
- e.g. `fizzbuzz(1, 100)` or `fizzbuzz(6..28)`






3. FizzBuzz with customizable behavior (much harder)

Make your fizzbuzz function take one more parameter that tells the function to print
anything you want based on whatever divisibility rules you want

e.g. print Chicken, Duck, Goose, or Turkey if the number is divisible by 3, 4, 5, or 7
`fizzbuzz(1, 100, bird_conditions)`

there are a lot of ways to do this and they're all fine as long as the birds and numbers
are given to the fizzbuzz function, and do not appear inside the fizzbuzz function.

This one requires techniques I haven't mentioned, so Google around for inspiration!
